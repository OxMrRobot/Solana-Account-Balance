# Solana Account Balance

This project is a simple example of retrieving and displaying the balance of a Solana account using Solana's JSON-RPC API.

## How It Works

1. **Clone the Project**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OxMrRobot/Solana-Ethereum-Account-Balance.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor.

3. **Configure the Public Key**: Replace the value of the `publicKey` variable in the JavaScript code with the public key of the account whose balance you want to retrieve.

4. **Configure the Solana API**: No additional configuration is required to use the Solana API. The code is already set up to interact with the Solana devnet API.

5. **Open the HTML File in a Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see the title "Solana Account Balance" followed by the balance of the specified Solana account.

## Note

Be sure to keep your private key private and not share it publicly. This public key is used for demonstration purposes only in this project.
